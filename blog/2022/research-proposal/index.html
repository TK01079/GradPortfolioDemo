<p>This research aims to examine the visual media of graphic novels via research on craft and rhetorical choices to determine the most effective moves to creating a piece of graphic fiction that bridges the literary and genre fiction fields. Based on a critical framework inspired by Scott McLoud’s Understanding Comics the follow research questions will be approached: What is the benefit of visual or mixed-media literature? Why graphic and not just a novel? What effective craft moves are the authors making to create a successful piece of a literature in a mixed or visual media format? The ultimate goal of this research is to understand the value of the graphic novel as a piece of stand-alone literature.</p>

<p>This research will consist of reading graphic novels, graphic memoirs, and critical resources on craft, writing, and theory of graphic fiction. As an exercise for application of craft I will also work on my own graphic novel. The goal of this piece is to complete a chapter along with storyboarding and outlining for the rest of the project. The final element of this project will be a reflective/research essay between 5-8 pages to provide critical analysis of the graphic novel genre and the autoethnographic benefit of exploring my own craft with this project.</p>

<p>This research aligns particularly well with the Liberal Studies multidisciplinary nature. Since the concept of Graphic Novels is, itself a form of combined disciplines, it is important, especially in the Masters of Liberal Studies to explore the practical application of multidisciplinary learning systems in the real world. My qualifications to undertake this research come from my undergraduate background in English and Creative writing: where I took a Graphic Novels literature class with Dr. Forsythe and completed a section of a historical fiction novel for my undergraduate thesis. At the Master’s level I have completed literature analysis and rhetorical analysis and taken Modern Literature, Jane Austen and George Eliot, and Research Methods courses which all tie in to the framework of this research.</p>
