## A Breif Discussion of Fiction

It occured to me, after closing *Understanding Comics* for the third time in my academic career, that it was about time I made a comic of my own. Most of my friends and colleagues who know me well, will recognize this piece from a myraid of conversations and passions across my years in University. Genre Fiction, of course, was my first love. I have since graduated to find excitiment in a variety of creative fields, but I return to fiction every few months and develop a bit more how I might bring it in to my professional and pedagogical interests. 

This work, a small comic inspired by the style of Scott McCloud seemed the best way to bring my visualized concept of how we might find cultural, philosophical, and moral value in works that are not traditionally thought of as being *literary*. This small comic represents the first steps of my work toward integrating pop-culture and genre fiction more smoothly into valued lituerature studies. 



### On Genre Fiction
For Dr. F, who assigned McCloud in Freshman year and put up with my long-winde oppinions on *Star Wars* for many, many years.
